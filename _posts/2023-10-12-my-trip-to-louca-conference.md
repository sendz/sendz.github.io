It's been long time since I attend my last conference as speaker or participant, my last conference was LibreOffice Conference Indonesia 2018 in Surabaya, Indonesia. It's not any other regular-ordinary conference, because the event held for both LibreOffice and Ubuntu conference in Asia, and I expect more people to come.

## The Motivation

What motivated me to join this conference are to gather with my friend across Indonesia, they are passionated in Open Source movement and always inspired me, and of course to share my "side project" since pandemic era.

I submitted 3 (three) papers about Ubuntu Touch, Pi-Hole in Set Top Box device (Digital TV STB), and Mechanical Keyboard with KiCad. Fortunately, my last paper about designing Mechanical Keyboard with KiCad accepted and the other two are archived, it means I can share my project, my hobby since pandemic to broader audience.

## Day 0

I live in Sleman City, Yogyakarta Province, ~60km from Surakarta City, or you can call it Solo City that can be very confusing (I asked what is difference between Surakarta and Solo to a friend who lives there, he is not sure). The plan is to depart at Friday evening, but my son already excited to do the trip early.

All packed, preparation are done, and prizes for all participants are ready to go!

The session took at G Building at 1G111 Room, it was hot with the current weather and the aircond in the class are not working as my expectation, however the show must go on.

I didn't prepare it enough, as many problem encountered during the session, such as I need to change my HDMI to VGA converter, and my KiCad app attempted to crash during the session.

Probably the most interesting part in my session is when I gave away some keyboard kit, I brough 3 kits to my session to whoever raised any question, and also thanks to Piko who brought us a custom PCB as prize.

The tradition remains, the dinnertime gather us to socialize for speakers, committee and volunteer. I didn't talk too much on this dinner as I need to play with Kaysan who play in front area of the restaurant.

Unfortunately the food was so-so, could be better.

## Day 2

I got extra T-Shirt for the 2nd day of conference, it was special treat for speakers. I spent the 2nd day with Kaysan and his new friends, so not much I did in this day.

![Juniors Meeting]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20231008_160346.jpg)

As more people came and bring their kids, we need to consider playroom for kids in our next conference.

### Timor Leste bidding for UbuCon Asia Next Year!

The interesting part in 2nd day is we have people from Timor Leste, long story short, Timor Leste was part of Indonesia until they declare their independence and become a sovereign country. This is exciting because I never land to Timor Leste and people here are supporting them to host the same conference there.

### The Dinner

2nd day dinner took in different restaurant, and we have better food here. Thank you!

The dinner was special, as we have two people had birthday, my wife and Youngbin Han.
